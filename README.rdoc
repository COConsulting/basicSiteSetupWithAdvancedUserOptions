== README

This is a template webApp being developed to provide the basics for a working site. It will have a user dashboard and profile using the devise gem and expanded options. It will also have an administrator dashboard to manage users. From here, a person could build onto this app do whatever they want.



## Versions
* App: 0.1.3.2
* Ruby: 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin14]
* Rails: 4.2.0



## Configuration

After you setup the first user (probably your account), you will need to go into the database and set the security_level to '5' in order to gain administrator abilities. From here, you will be able to change the status of all other user accounts via the administrator dashboard. Please also note that an admin can not delete their own account, but it will need to be deleted by another administrator. This provides security that the site is not without an administrator. 



## To Do List

- [ ] I'd like the redirect page after signing in or signing out to be back to the page the user was on, not the home page. But, the request.referer always gives an error. 
- [ ] Create Admin Dashboard
	- [ ] Prevent Admins from deleting their own account
	- [ ] Allow Admins to change status of users
	- [ ] Allow Admins to update user information
- [ ] Integrate [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth)
- [ ] Run <tt>rake doc:app</tt> at the end
